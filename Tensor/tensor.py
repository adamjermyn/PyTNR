	A tensor is a multilinear function mapping a series of vectors (also known as indices) to a scalar.
	It must have shape, rank, and size attributes and an attribute returning the logarithm of the largest-magnitude element.
	It must implement __str__ (for printing), as well as contraction with another tensor and tracing between
	a pair of its indices.
