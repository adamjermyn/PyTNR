	This is a helper method for SVD calculations.

	In the case where the matrix of interest was formed as a product A*B where
	A.shape[1] == B.shape[0] << A.shape[0], B.shape[1], the SVD is mathematically
	guaranteed to return at most A.shape[1] nonzero singular values, and so
	we ought to use an iterative solver rather than the full solver.

	In the remaining cases the iterative solve will fail because it cannot retrieve
	all singular values of a matrix (it can retrieve at most one fewer). This is
	just an implementation detail, and only arises in rare cases, so we just revert
	to the full SVD solve.

	If an optimizerArray is provided, we perform the procedure outlined in Eq7-13
	in "Second Renormalization of Tensor-Network States" by Xie et. al. (arXiv:0809.0182v3).

	This method accepts as input:
		matrix 			-	The matrix to SVD.
		bondDimension	-	The bond dimension used to form the matrix (i.e. A.shape[1]).
		optimizerTensor	-	The 'environment' array to optimize against.

	This method returns:
		u 	-	A matrix of the left singular vectors
		lam	-	An array of the singular values
		v 	-	An array of the right singular vectors
		p 	-	An array whose entries reflect the portion of the total weight in each
				singular value.
		cp 	-	An array whose entries reflect the cumulative portion of the total weight
				associated with all singular values past a given index.

	As a result of the above definitions, p and cp are both sorted in descending order.
