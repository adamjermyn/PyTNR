	'''
	A treeNetwork is a special case of a Network in which the Network being represented
	contains no cycles. This allows matrix elements of a treeNetwork to be efficiently
	evaluated.

	As the only quantities which matter are the matrix elements, the treeNetwork may
	refactor itself through singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize memory use, and
	so no assumptions should be made about the Nodes in this object, just the external
	Buckets.

	Internally all Nodes of a treeNetwork have rank-3 Tensors. SVD factoring is used
	to enforce this.
