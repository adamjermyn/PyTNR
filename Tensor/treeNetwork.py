	A treeNetwork is a special case of a Network in which the Network being represented
	contains no cycles. This allows matrix elements of a treeNetwork to be efficiently
	evaluated.

	As the only quantities which matter are the matrix elements, the treeNetwork may
	refactor itself through singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize memory use, and
	so no assumptions should be made about the Nodes in this object, just the external
	Buckets.

	Internally all Nodes of a treeNetwork have Tensors of rank at most 3.
	SVD factoring is used to enforce this.
