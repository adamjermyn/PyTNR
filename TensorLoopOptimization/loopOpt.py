	N is given by contracting all of t2 against itself except for the tensors at the specified index.
	This yields a rank-6 object, where two indices arise from the implicit identity present in the bond
	between the two copies of t2[index].
	
	W is given by contracting all of t2 (other than t2[index]) against t1. This yields a rank-3 object.

	We then let
