    Let A be the tensor given by the portion of the loop between index1 (exclusive) and
    index2 (inclusive), and let C be the complement. Let envA and envC be the portions
    of the environment tensor which contract against A and C respectively.

    The reduced density matrix after tracing out the external legs of C is

    R = envA . A . C . envC . envC* . C* . A* . envA*

    where the dot product means summation over shared indices and * denotes a transpose.
    Note that the structure of this network is such that the above notation is associative.

    Let

    D = C . envC . envC* . C*

    This is Hermitian, so Sqrt[D] exists. Hence with

    K = envA . A . Sqrt[D]

    we find

    R = K . K*.

    The conjugate density matrix is given by

    Q = K* . K = Sqrt[D]* . envA* . A* . A . envA . Sqrt[D]

    This method returns Q.

    Note:

    It can be shown that R and Q have the same non-zero eigenvalues. This is because the
    non-zero eigenvalues of AB are the same as those of BA for any A and B, which in turn
    follows from the fact that the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix
    M depend only on powers of trace(M^n) and trace((AB)^n) = trace((BA)^n).

    This is useful because Q is much smaller in size than R and so can be used to efficiently
    compute the bond dimensions of cuts.
