# Using PyTNR

Programs using PyTNR typically consist of two phases.
In the first phase they construct a tensor network.
To begin, make a network as follows:
```python
from TNR.Network.network import Network
network = Network()
```
This initializes an empty tensor network.

To insert tensors into the network, construct an array representing the tensor of interest, construct a Tensor object, and use that to construct a Node object:
```python
from TNR.Network.node import Node
from TNR.Tensor.arrayTensor import ArrayTensor
import numpy as np
arr = np.random.randn(3, 3, 3, 2)
tens = ArrayTensor(arr)
node = Node(tens)
```

In general you should construct all of your nodes and link them up to each other before adding them to your network.
This is because the Network class automatically classifies internal and external links at the time that nodes are added.
Linking nodes is done as follows:
```python
# Assumes n1 and n2 are Nodes
l = Link(n1.bucket[0], n2.bucket[0])
```
The `.buckets` specification indicates which index of a given node to link.
The buckets are just a way of keeping track of indices, and are numbered in the same way as the indices of the tensor.
Once the nodes are linked appropriately, add them to the network:
```python
network.addNode(n1)
network.addNode(n2)
```

Finally, the network can be contracted.
This is done using a contraction manager and a contraction heuristic.
For instance,
```
# Assumes network is a Network
from TNRG.Contractors.mergeContractor import mergeContractor
from TNRG.Contractors.heuristics import utilHeuristic
accuracy = 1e-3
n = mergeContractor(network, accuracy, utilHeuristic, optimize=True)
```
That's all there is to it. Now `n` contains a tensor tree or collection of tensor trees representing the contraction of `network`.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask, and also please take a look at the provided examples (in Examples /).
