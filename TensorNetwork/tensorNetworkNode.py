class Link:
	'''
	A Link is a means of indicating an intent to contract two tensors.
	This object has two Buckets, one for each Node being connected.
	In addition, it has a method for computing the von Neumann entropy of the Link.
	In cases where this computation is intractable due to memory requirements, a heuristic
	is used.

	Links have the following functions:

	bucket1		-	Returns the first Bucket this link connects to.
	bucket2		-	Returns the second Bucket this link connects to.
	entropy		-	Returns the entropy of the Link. Heuristics are used where memory requires them.
	compress	-	Compresses the Link uses Singular Value Decomposition. This involves modifying
					the Tensors the link contains, and so will trigger deletion of Links higher up
					in the heirarchical network structure.
	delete		-	Removes this link from both 

	Links are instantiated with the buckets they connect, and are added to the end of the Link
	lists of their buckets. They are also added to the link registry of their TensorNetwork.

class Bucket:
	'''
	A Bucket is a means of externally referencing an index of a tensor which handles the way in which
	the tensor is linked to other tensors.

	Each Bucket references exactly one index, but may contain multiple Links between that index and others.
	This allows a given tensor to be part of a heirarchical network, wherein nodes may be merged while
	retaining information about the unmerged structure. To accomodate this, each Bucket contains a list
	of Links. When two nodes are merged, the old links remain, while a new Link to the merged object
	is added to the end of the Link list.

	Buckets have the following functions:

	node 		-	Returns the Node this Bucket belongs to.
	index 		-	Returns the index of the Node's Tensor this Bucket refers to.
	network 	-	Returns the TensorNetwork this Bucket belongs to.
	numLinks	-	Returns the number of Links this Bucket has.
	links 		-	Returns all Links this Bucket has.
	link 		-	Takes as input an integer specifying the index of the Link of interest and returns
					that link.
	otherBucket	-	Takes as input an integer specifying the index of the Link of interest and returns
					the Bucket on the other side of that Link.
	otherNode	-	Takes as input an integer specifying the index of the Link of interest and returns
					the Node on the other side of that Link.
	addLink		-	Takes as input a Link and appends it to the end of the Link list.
	removeLink	-	Removes a Link from the Link list. Raises a ValueError if the Link is not present.

class Node:
	'''
	A Node object stores the Buckets corresponding to a given Tensor.
	It also provides helper methods allowing for easy access to neighbors.

	Node objects have the following functions which do not modify them:

	id 				-	Returns the id number of the Node. These numbers are unique within a network.
	children		-	Returns the children Nodes (if any) which merged to form this Node.
	parent			-	Returns the Node (if any) which this merges to form.
	connected		-	Returns the Nodes this one is connected to.
	connectedHigh	-	Returns the Nodes this one is connected to, giving the highest-level list possible.
						That is, the list such that no element of the set has a parent which is connected
						to this Node, and such that all Nodes connected to this one are children to some
						degree of an element in the list.
	tensor 			-	Returns the Tensor underlying this Node.
	merge 			-	Takes as input another Node and merges this Node with it. The net result is that
						a new node is added to the network. This Node and the other are left intact, with
						all of their Links preserved. The rest of the network's Nodes will have Links both
						to these and to the new Node, with Links to the new Node appearing later in their
						Link lists.

	There are additional functions which do modify Nodes, listed below. These functions result in automatic
	deletion of all Nodes formed by merging this Tensor with others.

	outerProduct	-	Takes as input a Tensor and modifies the Tensor underlying this one to be
						the outer product of the original and the input. The input is indexed last
						in the new Tensor. This is useful for lattice sites, for instance, where the
						Tensor is really just the identify and there may be several Links added.
	modify 			-	Takes as input a Tensor of the same shape as the underlying Tensor object and
						replaces the underlying one with it. Note that a ValueError will be raised if
						the shapes do not match.
	delete			-	Delete the Node and all associated Links.
