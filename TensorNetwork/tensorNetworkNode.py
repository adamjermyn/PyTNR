class Node:
	'''
	A Node object stores the Buckets corresponding to a given Tensor.
	It also provides helper methods allowing for easy access to neighbors.

	Node objects have the following functions which do not modify them:

	id 				-	Returns the id number of the Node. These numbers are unique within a network.
	children		-	Returns the children Nodes (if any) which merged to form this Node.
	parent			-	Returns the Node (if any) which this merges to form.
	connected		-	Returns the Nodes this one is connected to.
	connectedHigh	-	Returns the Nodes this one is connected to, giving the highest-level list possible.
						That is, the list such that no element of the set has a parent which is connected
						to this Node, and such that all Nodes connected to this one are children to some
						degree of an element in the list.
	tensor 			-	Returns the Tensor underlying this Node.
	merge 			-	Takes as input another Node and merges this Node with it. The net result is that
						a new node is added to the network. This Node and the other are left intact, with
						all of their Links preserved. The rest of the network's Nodes will have Links both
						to these and to the new Node, with Links to the new Node appearing later in their
						Link lists.

	There are additional functions which do modify Nodes, listed below. These functions result in automatic
	deletion of all Nodes formed by merging this Tensor with others.

	trace			-	Traces over 
	modify 			-	Takes as input a Tensor of the same shape as the underlying Tensor object and
						replaces the underlying one with it. Note that a ValueError will be raised if
						the shapes do not match.
	delete			-	Delete the Node and all associated Links.

	TODO:
	1. Implement merge.
	2. Implement linking function (addLink).
	3. Implement trace.
