class Link:
	'''
	A Link is a means of indicating an intent to contract two tensors.
	This object has two Buckets, one for each Node being connected.
	In addition, it has a method for computing the von Neumann entropy of the Link.
	In cases where this computation is intractable due to memory requirements, a heuristic
	is used.

	Links have the following functions:

	bucket1			-	Returns the first Bucket this Link connects to.
	bucket2			-	Returns the second Bucket this Link connects to.
	network 		-	Returns the Network this link belongs to.
	parent 			-	Returns the parent of this Link.
	children 		-	Returns the children of this Link.
	setParent		-	Takes as input a Link and sets it as the parent of this Link.
	otherBucket		-	Takes as input a Bucket. Raises a ValueError if it is not one of the
						Buckets associated with this Link. If it is one of them, returns the other.
	mergeEntropy	-	Returns the expected change in the entropy of the network
						were the link to be contracted. Heuristics are used on the
						assumption that links are being compressed regularly. Assumes compression
						would be performed on top-Level nodes.
	updateMergeEntropy	-	Updates the stored merge entropy. Should only be called from the update() method.
	update 			-	Called whenever a Bucket this Link points to gains or loses a Node. Updates merged
						entropy and corrects/registers the top/not top status of the Link.
	compressed 		-	Returns True if this Link was the result of a compression operation, False otherwise.
	setCompressed	-	Sets the Link compress variable to True.
	delete			-	Removes this link from both 

	Links are instantiated with the buckets they connect, and are added to the end of the Link
	lists of their buckets. They are also added to the link registry of their TensorNetwork.
